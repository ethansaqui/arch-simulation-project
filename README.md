# IEEE-754 Binary-64 Floating-Point Converter

A IEEE-754 Binary-64 converter made using typescript. Access on this link: https://arch-simulation-project.vercel.app

Please note: Since vercel is a free low-memory deployment, spamming the "convert" button may cause a crash

## Getting Started
To get started, simply open your preferred web browser and navigate to our web application's URL. Once you are on the homepage, you will see a form that asks for an input value.

### Entering Input Values
You can enter either a decimal or binary input value in the input field. If you enter a decimal value, make sure it is a valid decimal number. If you enter a binary value, make sure it is a valid binary number. Also select the appropriate base value in the drop down, or NaN if that is your selected input.

### Converting Input Value
After selecting your desired output format, simply click the "Convert" button. The application will then convert your input value into its corresponding IEEE assembly and display the result in the output field.
